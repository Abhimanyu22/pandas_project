# Runs scored on one ball

Let's try to get an idea of how many runs do batsmen make most on one ball.

So we essentially want a "runs scored" to count of occurrences mapping

Create a function that answers this question.

**The function should **
- Be named `get_run_counts`
- Work on the previously created `ipl_df` object
- Should return a Series with runs as the index and their frequencies (counts) as the values

## Parameters
No parameters


## Returns
- runs_count: runs scored and count of occurences `dtype: Series`
