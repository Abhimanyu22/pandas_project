## Read csv into a DataFrame
What's the use of data and pandas if we can't even import the data?
This assignment aims to help you get comfortable importing data stored in one of the most used 
formats: `.csv`

Create a function `read_csv_data_to_df` that returns a Pandas DataFrame when given a path to a CSV file
Use that `path` to read the CSV file and return the pandas dataframe (using a standard library 
function)

## Parameters
- path: path of the file to be loaded `dtype: str`


## Returns
- df: Data in the csv file. `dtype: DataFrame`
